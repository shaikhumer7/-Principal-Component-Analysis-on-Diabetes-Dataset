# Principal Component Analysis on Diabetes Dataset

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to the Diabetes dataset for dimensionality reduction and improved visualization. PCA is a key technique in unsupervised machine learning used to reduce the number of features while preserving as much variance as possible.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Diabetes dataset
- Standardize features before applying PCA
- Reduce dimensionality and identify the principal components
- Visualize data distribution before and after PCA
- Interpret the explained variance and contribution of each principal component

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Applied **scikit-learn's PCA** implementation on standardized data
- Plotted **explained variance ratios** to determine optimal components
- Visualized **2D projections** of the dataset using top principal components
- Identified patterns and relationships in reduced dimensions
